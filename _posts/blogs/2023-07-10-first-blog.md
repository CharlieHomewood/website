Hello and welcome! Thanks for stopping by to read this blog post and visiting my website :)

I've wanted to build a website for several months now, but uni work always took priority and as such I never dedicated much time to working on this outside of browsing the internet for tutorials and guides. Now I've graduated, I've spent the last couple of weeks working on learning the basics of making a website. I initally started by just writing a few HTML files and a stylesheet in CSS  but quickly realised that this process could be made simpler and more efficient. A static-site generator was ideal for what I was looking to achieve with this website - a place for me to share my work, as well as being an opportunity for me to learn the basics of web design. I chose to use <a id="text-link" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll<a/>, but did not want to be shoehorned into a particular Jekyll theme (as amazing many of them are), nor did I want to abandon being able to learn web design skills. The result is "**this**". 

I have fully enjoyed my first steps into web design and am happy to make the current state of this website my starting point. I hope to make many changes in the future to improve its look and feel, but I do also now want to get on with using the website for its intended purpose. I'm currently working on an analysis project relating to my passion for football. My plan is to work towards creating *percentile radars* to represent how individual football players compare to the overall distribution of players in Europe's top 5 club divisions across a variety of metrics. These charts are commonly used by analysts and journalists across the footballing world and, personally, I really like how they enable a quick and easy way to interpret a player's ability or style of play, eventually reaching a point where the reader need only rely on pattern recognition alone to make powerful judgements about players.

I plan to start this project on a slight tangent by developing a way to scrape data from <a id="text-link" href="https://fbref.com/en/">fbref.com</a> - the data source being used in this project - and cleaning that data so it is ready to be used in creating our percentile radars. I am aware of packages design for scraping fbref data, but I want to try process this out for myself and want to futureproof it so I may use the code in future projects. On a side note, I recognise that not all readers may be familiar with some stats that are specific to football (e.g. xG, progressive carries, live-ball passes etc. etc.), so I plan to give my explanation of those when appropriate as we go along. Hopefully this will be accessible to anyone who is interested and I'm keen to hear your feedback.

I'm very excited to get started with this project and to make content for this website. I will upload posts on the <a id="otherpage-link" href="{{site.baseurl}}/projects/project1">project's page</a> in stages and plan to also make a YouTube video to summarise the entire process.
