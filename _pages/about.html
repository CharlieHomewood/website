                Hello, I'm Charlie! I'm a recent graduate with a BSc in Psychology with Economics who is passionate about applying skills I've developed (and am still developing) in data science to learn more about topics and questions that grip my interest. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Here you will find a <a id="about-content-link" href="{{ site.baseurl}}/projects/">repository of analysis projects</a> I've worked on (or am still working on) in my spare time. I aim to showcase my approaches, step-by-step, so that others can follow along in exploring various topics. At the same time, I also want to demonstrate my skills in data science and open myself up to suggestions on how to improve. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These projects may range from serious academic subjects to simply my hobbies, or anything else in-between or otherwise. For instance, I'm a huge football fan and am keen to apply data science skills to the sport I love to engage with it in a new way, finally settling the most heated of fan debates in a data-driven way once and for all (okay maybe not once and for all). 
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite my passion for data science, I'm also interested in exploring topics in a less data-science-driven manner. For example, my dissertation at university focused on reproducibility in psychological research. Whilst the project was weighted heavily in data analysis (reproducing experimental results in R), it also encouraged a consideration for meta-scientific issues like <a id="about-content-link" href="https://www.cos.io/open-science" target="_blank"><i>Open Science Practices</i></a>. As such, I'm also keen to share my thoughts on a wider range of topics such as issues in science, perspective in sciences like psychology and philosophy. I'll touch on these topics via <a id="about-content-link" href="{{ site.baseurl}}/blog/">blog posts</a>.
